## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Solution involved using binary search to find the pivot, unpivoting the array
and then once again running binary search. This solution is not exactly the
fastest and I feel like it's possible with a single binary search using a bit
of math possibly?

Took quite a bit of time to implement the binary search with correct indicies,
should definitely review template for binary search.

## 48. Rotate Image

Pretty simple, just transposed the matrix and then reversed each row.

## 151. Reverse Words in a String

O(n) space implemention is very easy. To implement it with O(1) space we can
just reverse the entire string then reverse each words individually.
