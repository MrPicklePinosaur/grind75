Although it was clear what the solution of this problem was, I had some issues
with implementation. Basically all that needed to be done was to detect a loop
in graph, but kept making mistakes with the recursive solution (when to visited
a node, when do we know that there is a loop, etc). Definitely should review
DFS psuedocode. Also should review implementation details on how to do DFS both
recursively and iteratively.
